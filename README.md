# hello-world-
My first repository on GitHub
Hi my name is Nikita but my friends call me Nikki, I have always been interested in learning how to code.

I have tried to learn HTML on my own before but got stuck along the way and didn't know what to do next.
I love to read and doing activities outdoors.
